            <h1>What makes a good vision and mission statement?</h1>
            <p>A good vision and mission statement is concise and inspirational.
                It’s easy to memorize and repeat.
                It should be clear, engaging, and realistic, and describe a bright future.
                It should state your intentions, summarize your values, and demonstrate your commitment to living up to
                these values.</p>

            <h1>Review your vision and mission statement</h1>
            <p>As your view of yourself and the future changes, it is important that you review, update and refine your
                vision and mission statement at least once every six months. If you feel really inspired, you may even
                want to expand it with more detail and turn it into a person development plan. so get scribbling and
                imagine how nice it will be to start out in Janaury with a clear roadmap for where you want to go and
                how to get there!</p>
